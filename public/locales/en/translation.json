  "title": "Five Years of Pain, a Decade of Healing",
  "paragraph1": "A 12-year-old boy. Shy, simple. One night, something happened that changed his life forever.",
  "paragraph2": "There were four people who spoke to me over the phone. Everything seemed fine — we even became ‘friends’. One of them was a close friend of mine. Then one day I got a message: 'Send me 5–10 shekels.' At first, I didn’t understand and just gave my 'friend' what he asked. But one day everything turned upside down — those 10 shekels became hundreds, then thousands.",
  "paragraph3": "I received daily threats to my life. They sent me horrifying photos of dead people, saying this would happen to me if I didn’t pay. They even warned that if I told anyone — they would shoot me.",
  "paragraph4": "As a small child, I was terrified and didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t sleep at night, I cried silently into my pillow so no one would hear. Until I lost my voice from crying too much.",
  "paragraph5": "Thoughts of suicide, of ending my life, fear of going outside — they were always in my head.",
  "paragraph6": "Every morning at school, as a formerly overweight kid, people mocked my body and insulted me — opening the bathroom door to take pictures, making me feel different, throwing words around, calling me names like 'tank'. What they didn’t know was that I came to school like a ‘corpse’, after nights filled with threats and tears.",
  "paragraph7": "I lived for years under fear, violence, and threats. Out of fear, I gave and paid all my money so they wouldn’t kill me.",
  "paragraph8": "I received threats to my life everywhere, at any time.",
  "paragraph9": "I didn’t speak to anyone for years. All I wanted was to die, to make it all stop.",
  "paragraph10": "They told me there were cameras watching me, even in the shower — that they had pictures of me naked. It made me so ashamed that I showered wearing a long shirt (I was 14).",
  "paragraph11": "One day we had a talk. I was on the floor, exhausted, begging my ‘friend’ for help — to talk to them, or give me more days to pay. But then something happened I could never imagine — he pulled out a gun, pointed it at my head, loaded the bullets and said they would shoot me — while I cried in fear.",
  "paragraph12": "I washed my face, calmed myself, and went home as if nothing happened.",
  "paragraph13": "They forbade me from going on school trips or social activities, always under threats.",
  "paragraph14": "After five years of hell — he came and told me the truth: he was behind everything. Those people never existed (I was 17).",
  "paragraph15": "At that moment I lost trust in everyone. Something inside me broke. I said one thing: when I was little, I dreamed of being a hero — never a victim. I didn’t hate him. The only person I hated was myself.",
  "paragraph16": "Over ten years of self-recovery — learning to accept myself and who I am. It took me 12 years to have the courage to tell my parents and friends. I paid almost 40,000 shekels in five years. I lost trust and connection with my family.",
  "paragraph17": "Traveling abroad helped me a lot, even became a hobby — but most people don’t know I travel to heal myself, to escape the thoughts and pain.",
  "paragraph18": "After October 7th, the horrible images triggered everything again. I remembered it all and fell into a dark place. I felt alone, scared, lost — there’s no worse feeling than losing yourself along the way.",
  "paragraph19": "But I never gave up. I lost 32 kilos, served in the army, grew, and learned to love myself. Today, thank God, I’m Raad Falah from Kisra-Sumei, 24 years old, proud of who I am and the strength I found to overcome it all.",
  "paragraph20": "Believe in yourself and never give up, not even for a moment. You’re stronger than you think. Don’t get stuck in the past — move forward to become the best version of yourself. Don’t compare yourself to others — everyone is special in their own way. 💙",
